Subject: [Griffith-user] german language file
Message-ID: <44A2CD8B.8030204@gmx.de>

Hi,

as mentioned in the forum,
http://griffith.vasconunes.net/forum/index.php?topic=101.0
I downloaded the german language file and translated the bits that were
missing and also corrected some errors.
I left two lines unchanged, since I cannot translate them without seeing
the context. I will look for it, as soon as I can.
